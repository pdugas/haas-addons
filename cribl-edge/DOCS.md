# Home Assistant Add-on: Cribl Edge

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Settings** -> **Add-ons** -> **Add-on store**.
2. Find the "Cribl Edge" add-on and click it.
3. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

The add-on has a couple of options available. To get the add-on running:

1. Start the add-on.
2. Have some patience and wait a couple of minutes.
3. Check the add-on log output to see the result.

## Configuration

Add-on configuration:

```yaml
logins: []
customize:
  active: false
  folder: mosquitto
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
require_certificate: false
```

### Option: `logins` (optional)

A list of local users that will be created with username and password. You donâ€™t need to do this because you can use Home Assistant users too, without any configuration. If a local user is specifically desired:

```yaml
logins:
  - username: user
    password: passwd
```

You can also optionally set a `password` value using the hashed password obtained from the `pw` command (which is present inside the Mosquitto container). If doing so, you must also specify `password_pre_hashed: true` alongside the `username` and `password` values:

```console
$ pw -p "foo"
PBKDF2$sha512$100000$qsU7xQ8YCV/9nRuBBJVTxA==$jqw94Ej3aEr97UofY6rClmVCRkTdDiubQW0A6ZYmUI+pZjW9Hax+2w2FeYB3y5ut1SliB7+HAwIl2iONLKkohw==
```

```yaml
logins:
  - username: user
    password: "PBKDF2$sha512$100000$qsU7xQ8YCV/9nRuBBJVTxA==$jqw94Ej3aEr97UofY6rClmVCRkTdDiubQW0A6ZYmUI+pZjW9Hax+2w2FeYB3y5ut1SliB7+HAwIl2iONLKkohw=="
    password_pre_hashed: true
```

## Disable listening on insecure (1883/1884) ports

Remove the ports from the add-on page network card (set them as blank) to disable them.

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)

It is possible to restrict access to topics based upon the user logged in to Mosquitto. In this scenario, it is recommended to create individual users for each of your clients and create an appropriate ACL.

See the following links for more information:

- [Mosquitto topic restrictions](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/topic-restriction-mosquitto-configuration/)
- [Mosquitto.conf man page](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-conf-5.html)

Add the following configuration to enable **unrestricted** access to all topics for `[YOUR_MQTT_USER]`.

**Note:** Home Assistant expects the users `homeassistant` and `addons` to have unrestricted readwrite access to all topics. If you choose to enable ACLs, you should grant this access to these users as demonstrated below. Otherwise you will run into issues.

1. Enable the customize flag

    ```yaml
      customize:
        active: true
        folder: mosquitto
    ```

2. Create `/share/mosquitto/acl.conf` with the contents:

    ```text
    acl_file /share/mosquitto/accesscontrollist
    ```

3. Create `/share/mosquitto/accesscontrollist` with the contents:

    ```text
    user addons
    topic readwrite #
    
    user homeassistant
    topic readwrite #
    
    user [YOUR_MQTT_USER]
    topic readwrite #
    ```

The `/share` folder can be accessed via SMB, or on the host filesystem under `/usr/share/hassio/share`.
